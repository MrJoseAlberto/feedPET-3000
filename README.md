# feedPET-3000

Dear Coleges,

This code was used in my final project to discipline of Microcontrolers and Microprocessors. The final project was a machine to feed Dogs according its weight and the hour of day. This repository has two main files: Biblioteca.txt and Trabalho_final2.txt. The first has methods to control a nokia 5110 display and the second has main functions of firmware.

Thanks to use that and have fun!
